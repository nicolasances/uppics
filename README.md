Uppics is a K8S-native microservice that only takes care of a simple thing: uploading pictures to your favourite storage.

It supports the following storages:
 * **Local storage**: it will just store the files to a mounted volume, up to you what you then want to do with that volume! 
 * **Google Cloud Storage**: it will store the files to google storage
